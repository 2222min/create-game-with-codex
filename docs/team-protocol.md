# Team Protocol

## Role Order per Cycle

1. Planner proposes a small milestone.
2. Market skeptic challenges commercial value.
3. Architect defines architecture slice and TDD plan.
4. Implementer ships the slice with tests.
5. Critical reviewer challenges code and architecture.
6. Designer updates required assets and integration specs.

## Debate Rule

- Reviewer and market skeptic are encouraged to disagree.
- A disagreement must include a concrete alternative.
- Planner resolves conflicts by selecting a single next action.

## Working Agreement

- One cycle = one playable improvement.
- Keep every task small enough to complete in one session.
- Maintain deterministic game state and testability.
- Track open decisions in `progress.md`.
